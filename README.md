Jekyll Starter
====================

Jekyll Starter is a starting point for responsive sites built on Jekyll without the distraction of a complicated theme pre installed.

To get started, Fork this repo and [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation).

## Tools

  * Jekyll 3.3
  * Bootstrap4


Just run 'jekyll s' and you should then be able to access the site locally on http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Notes

  * If you're on vagrant do 'jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --force_polling'
